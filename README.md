> My "hire me" page.

Made with [jade](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade) & [stylus](https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus), with [kouto swiss](https://github.com/leny/kouto-swiss) framework.

Currently hosted on [hire.flatland.be](http://hire.flatland.be), on my server, I think the code might deserve a little update, firstly by using jade & stylus, with my [kouto-swiss](https://github.com/krkn/kouto-swiss) css framework.
